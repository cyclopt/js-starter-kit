My JS web application starter kit

For devops we are using npm scripts.

- `back-end`: this folder contain back-end code (node and database related stuff)
- `buildScripts`: this folder contains devops code
- `front-end`: this directory holds the front-end react based code and was created using create-react-app. The ultimate guide for modifying this can be found [here](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md)
