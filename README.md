# js-starter-kit

This project is a JavaScript web application starter kit. The goal of the project is to have a starting point and have decisions made for you in order to battle jsfatigue.

The kit uses React-Redux in the front-end and json-server as a back-end. For task automation it uses npm-scripts. The front-end was scaffolded using [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The basic fodler structure is:
- `back-end`: this folder contains back-end code (express and database related stuff should be added here).
- `front-end`: this directory holds the front-end react based code and was created using create-react-app. The ultimate guide for modifying this can be found [here](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md)
- `scripts`: this folder contains scripts for needed for various tasks.

Some of the main dependencies of the kit and their utiliy are found in the following table:

| Dependency | Description |
| --- | --- |
|  |  |
|  |  |

Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) is made through travis-ci on heroku. A running version of the app can be found [here](heroku).

Ideas for this kit are taken from:

- Cory House courses:
  - https://github.com/coryhouse/pluralsight-redux-starter
  - https://github.com/coryhouse/javascript-development-environment
